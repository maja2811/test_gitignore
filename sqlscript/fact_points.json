Can we create external tables with multiple files? or do we need to create partitioned files and create views on top? What is possible with pipelines?\n   This specific data does not work exactly this way, as this is all on past data. However, to mimic a more difficult delta load, we pretend it works this way.\n   Ideally, we should be able to create external tables that creates multiple files on which we can decide to truncate load or not? (can be obtained by notebook partition + view and creating pipeline logic that needs to find out what to load../overwrite)\n*/\n\nDROP VIEW IF EXISTS sapcrm.fact_points\nGO\nCREATE VIEW sapcrm.fact_points AS\nSELECT \n    SUM(lpk.[TOTPOINTS]) AS total_points,\n    CAST(lma.[ACT_DATE] AS DATE) AS [activity_date],\n    lpk.[TXNREASON___T] AS reason,\n    lma.[CATEGORY] AS category\nFROM OPENROWSET(\n        BULK 'sapcrm/CLOYMEDA2.parquet',\n        DATA_SOURCE = 'sapcrm',\n        FORMAT='PARQUET'\n    ) AS lma  \nLEFT JOIN  OPENROWSET(\n        BULK 'sapcrm/CLOYPOKO2.parquet',\n        DATA_SOURCE = 'sapcrm',\n        FORMAT='PARQUET'\n    ) AS lpk ON lpk.[MSH_GUID] = lma.MENB_GUID\n        AND lma.MEDL_GUID = lpk.ACTI_GUID\nWHERE lpk.[0BPARTNER] IS NOT NULL AND lma.[ACT_DATE] BETWEEN 20220701 AND 20220731\nGROUP BY  \n    lma.[ACT_DATE],\n    lpk.[TXNREASON___T],\n    lma.[CATEGORY]\n--ORDER BY lma.[ACT_DATE]\n\n",
